# Licensing and Code of Conduct

### Why did we choose the MIT license?
The MIT license is simple and permissive. It doesn't apply many restrictions, which is perfect for a basic open source project like this. It also absolves us (the authors) of liability and does not provide a warranty. Additionally, it's one of the most widely used open source licenses, so new contributors will have some familiarity with it already.

### Why did we choose Contributor Covenant for our code of conduct?
Contributor Covenant is used by over 100,000 projects, some of which include AngularJS, Kubernetes, and React. It focuses on creating an open and compassionate community among contributors, which is in line with our values as creators. One of the best qualities of Contributor Covenant is its enforcement guidelines; it provides a framework to punish those that do not follow the code of conduct.
